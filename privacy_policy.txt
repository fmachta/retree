  Privacy Policy for Retree  

  Last Updated:   [Date You Finalize This Policy]

Welcome to Retree! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you when you use our mobile application ("App").

  1. Information We Collect  

We collect the following types of information:

      Account Information:  
          Email Address:   If you choose to register or sign in using your email and password, we collect your email address via Firebase Authentication.
          Username:   You may provide a username, which will be associated with your account and displayed on leaderboards. If you do not provide one, a default identifier (like your email or "Anonymous Player") may be used.
          Firebase User ID (UID):   A unique identifier automatically assigned by Firebase Authentication to your account (including anonymous accounts).
      Gameplay Information:  
          High Scores:   We collect the scores you achieve in the games within the App.
          Timestamps:   We record the time when high scores are saved.
      Anonymous Usage:   If you use the App without creating an email/password account, we use Firebase Anonymous Authentication, which assigns a temporary UID to track your session and high scores without collecting personal identifiers like your email.

  2. How We Use Your Information  

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

      To Provide and Manage Your Account:   To allow you to register, sign in, and manage your Retree account.
      To Operate the Game:   To save your high scores and display them.
      To Provide Leaderboards:   To display your username and high scores on global game leaderboards.
      To Improve the App:   We may analyze aggregated, non-identifiable usage data to understand how the App is used and make improvements (though specific analytics collection isn't explicitly seen in the current code review).
      To Communicate with You:   (Optional - Add if you plan to send emails, e.g., for password resets) To send you necessary service-related communications.

  3. Data Sharing and Third Parties  

We do not sell your personal information. We share information only in the following circumstances:

      Firebase (Google):   We use Firebase services (Authentication and Cloud Firestore) provided by Google to operate the App. Firebase stores your authentication credentials, UID, username, high scores, and timestamps on our behalf. Google's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policies.
      Leaderboards:   Your chosen username and high scores are displayed publicly on the in-app leaderboards.
      Legal Requirements:   We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

  4. Data Storage and Security  

Your information (account details, scores, username) is stored on servers provided by Google Cloud Firestore. We rely on the security measures implemented by Google Firebase to protect your data. While we and our service providers strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
